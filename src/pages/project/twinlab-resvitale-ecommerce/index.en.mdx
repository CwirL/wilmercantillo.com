Twinlab Consolidated Corporation is an American company which manufactures and
markets vitamins, minerals, and bodybuilding supplements. Last year twinlab
entered into an agreement with Bonne Sante Group which means a partnership with
brands such as Reserveage, REAAL, ResVitale and Metabolife. The partnership aims
to deliver twinlab innovative products on an expedited basis while still
maintaining the companyâ€™s overarching commitments to quality science-based,
nutritional supplements, including a complete line of vitamins, minerals and
sports nutrition products.

## Development team

This project was developed mainly by a team of 6 talented people from codelab303
and sancrisoft teams, one techlead, one creative technologist (who focused on
the ui building blocks and styles), 2 team leaders and 2 full stack developers
(me included here).

## E Commerce Architecture & Design Process

Even though I was not part of this process I learnt a lot from the decisions
that were made here. The team leaders decided to built a headless ecommerce with
next js, shopify and contentful to take advantage of the powerful serving
strategies of next js.

As we can see in the diagram most of the backend functionalities comes from
third party services which allows better performance, scalability and bring all
the benefits of the jamstack.

## Ecommerce development process

Once the UX/UI team finished their work they end up with a very organized and
clean design in figma, which allowed the development process to be faster and
much more enjoyable.

A lof of learning took place throughout the process of building this application
since it was the first time working with all these technologies and APIs for me.
We decided to use a couple of templates for the boilerplate to get started with
the project: vercel commerce and next contentful integration example, so the
first thing to do was to get to know the boilerplate and how to make queries for
data fetching. Contentful was mainly used for web page dynamic content and
shopify to handle commerce functionalities and products data.

I was in charge of making the first dynamic page to handle blog articles coming
from contentful. For this I did a bit of research and learnt about next js
dynamic routes and next js functions _getStaticProps_ and _getStaticPaths_.
After getting routing up and working I focused on page template and style using
contentful richtext renderer package and sharethis package for the social
network share buttons. This was the ui requested by designers:

## Obstacles

We got limited by the shopify storefront API because it did not have endpoints
yet to make some functionalities. For example it was not possible to build a
custom subscriptions management page, because of this we decided to utilize
recharge customer portal.
