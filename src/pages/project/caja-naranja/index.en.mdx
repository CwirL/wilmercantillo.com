# Goal

<PAfterHeading>
  The objective of this project was to create a web application to offer
  warehouse storage service. The application has the following functionalities:
  online payment, email notifications, authentication and authorization.
</PAfterHeading>

# About the project

<PAfterHeading>
  I developed this project together with a friend, as a business idea and to
  explore the planning and construction process of a digital venture.
</PAfterHeading>

# Project construction

<PAfterHeading>
  In the initial phase of the project, we define the requirements for an MVP and
  we made the model of the <b> database </b> (MySQL) which would be mounted in
  an RDS on AWS.
</PAfterHeading>

Then do I made the **design** of a user interface for the landing page, the
login / register and a page to see a list of warehouses, in which you could
search and filter results.

For the **backend** of the application we use express to build a REST API, using
the MVC pattern, which had the following characteristics:

- Endpoints to bring warehouses data paginated and filtered based on query.
- Authentication and authorization service with JWT through passport library.
- Payment service using the mercadopago payment gateway.
- Mail notification service using the nodemailer library.

As for the **frontend** we carry out an SPA with the following characteristics:

- We use the Sass 7-1 pattern to handle the styles of the application.
- Login and registration pages.
- Page to explore warehouses, this page offers information about the state of
  the warehouses in real time.

# Conclusion

<PAfterHeading>
  Despite not having been able to continue with the execution of the project due
  to the situation of the global pandemic, this project was another important
  experience to develop skills that I would later need when working in the
  professional field. In addition to the large amount of work and effort
  required to bring a product idea to reality.
